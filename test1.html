          <p><b>Theory:</b></p>
       Water that is hard prevents lathering of soap. It is a characteristic water quality parameter. It is caused due to presence of certain salts of calcium, magnesium and other heavy metals dissolved in water. A sample of hard water, when treated with soap forms a white scum or precipitate. This precipitate is formed, due to the formation of insoluble soaps of calcium and magnesium.
           This water which does not produce lather with soap solution readily, but forms a white scum, is called hard water. Water which lathers easily on shaking with soap solution, is called soft water.
